# Debian QCOW Image Builder

A tool for automatically generating **Debian Bookworm** QCOW2 images for virtual machines. While optimized for Debian Bookworm, it should work with other Debian-based distributions as well.

## Overview

This repository contains a script that automates the process of creating a **Debian Bookworm** QCOW2 image. The image is pre-configured with essential packages, SSH access, and appropriate APT sources to allow for easy installation and configuration in virtualized environments.

Testing on additional platforms is ongoing. The tool is expected to work with Ubuntu 22.04+ and other Debian-based distributions.

## Requirements

The script configures these key components:
- **Core Packages**: libc6, systemd, openssh-server, sudo, and others.
- **SSH Root Access**: SSH login is enabled for the root user, with the password set to "root".
- **APT Sources**: Proper APT repository configuration is included to ensure correct package installation.
- **GRUB Configuration**: Ensures that the image is bootable in a QEMU environment.

## System Requirements

Before running the Debian QCOW2 Image Builder script, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Host System**:
  - OS: Linux (Debian or Ubuntu recommended)
  - Architecture: x86_64 (64-bit)
  - Kernel: 4.15+ (for QEMU/KVM compatibility)
  - RAM: 2GB minimum (4GB+ recommended)
  - Disk Space: 10GB+ free (depending on image size)
  - QEMU: Installed (`sudo apt install qemu-kvm`)

- **Required Dependencies**:
  - Debootstrap: `sudo apt install debootstrap`
  - Git: `sudo apt install git`
  - sudo: `sudo apt install sudo`

- **Optional**:
   - **Check CPU Virtualization Support**  
     Ensure that your CPU supports hardware virtualization (Intel VT-x for Intel processors or AMD-V for AMD processors).

  - **Enable Virtualization in BIOS**  
     Make sure that the virtualization extensions (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) are enabled in your systemâ€™s BIOS/UEFI settings for KVM acceleration.


## Quick Start

- Follow these steps to quickly set up the image:

 - **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gpal1/debian-qcow2-image-builder.git
   cd debian-qcow2-image-builder

 - **Run the Script to create Debian QCOW2 image**
   To create the Debian QCOW2 image, run the following command:
     
   ```bash
       ./debian-qcow2-image-builder.sh 2>&1 | tee qcow2-debian-bookworm-build.log

 - **Initiate QEMU Virtual Machine Boot**
     The script will display the command on screen, and you are expected to run the following command to boot the image in QEMU:
     ```bash
        sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -smp 1 -m 1024M \
       -drive id=d0,file=/root/debian_bookworm.qcow2,if=none,format=qcow2 \
       -device virtio-blk-pci,drive=d0,scsi=off \
       -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 -device virtio-net,netdev=net0 \
       -nographic

## Validation

The script includes both **automatic (offline)** and **manual (online)** validation steps to ensure the generated image is correctly configured and functional.

### Offline Validation (Automated)

The script automatically verifies the following:

- **Package Installation**: Ensures essential packages like `libc6`, `systemd`, `openssh-server` are installed.
- **SSH Configuration**: Verifies root login is enabled with the password set to "root".
- **APT Sources**: Confirms the correct entry is added to `/etc/apt/sources.list`.
- **Bootloader Setup**: Ensures GRUB is installed and properly configured.

### Online Validation (Manual)

After booting the image, you can manually verify the following:

- **Boot**: The image boots into a working Debian system.
- **SSH Access**: Verify SSH access using root credentials.
- **APT Repository**: Ensure the repository is accessible and can install packages.
- **System Services**: Confirm services like `network-manager` and `systemd` are operational.

## Troubleshooting

- **Booting issues**: Ensure KVM virtualization is enabled.
- **Image not booting**: Verify KVM and CPU virtualization (VT-x/AMD-V) are enabled.
